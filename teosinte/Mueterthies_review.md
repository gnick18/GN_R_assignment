# Review of Your R code
## by Jazelli Mueterthies

Well firstly, it ran through all the way without much issue, so that's good.

It did have a few warnings, but none that made the code stop.
* one such warning is the use of both dplyr and plyr libraries. It didn't like that much, but it did manage it.

* Rstudio recommends loading plyr first, and then dplyr to minimize problems.


Great work on the graphs! I myself had a lot of trouble figuring out the pivoting and how to get it in a usable format that I needed. So good job there!

Your use of a "while" loop was also interesting. I personally prefer For loops because I'm more comfortable with how they work, but it was neat to see it tackled in a different way! :)


Overall, very well done and complete! Nice job!
